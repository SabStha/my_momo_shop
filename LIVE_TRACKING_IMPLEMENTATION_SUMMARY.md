## 🎯 How It Works

### Customer Flow:

1. **Customer places order** on mobile app
2. **Kitchen staff confirms** order on web dashboard
3. **Kitchen marks as ready** when food is prepared
4. **Driver accepts delivery** on delivery dashboard (`/delivery`)
5. **Driver location starts broadcasting** every 10 seconds
6. **Customer sees "📍 Track Delivery" button** in order details
7. **Customer taps button** → Opens live map with driver location
8. **Map auto-updates** every 5 seconds
9. **Driver delivers** → Uploads photo proof
10. **Order marked delivered** → Customer gets notification

### Technical Flow:

```
