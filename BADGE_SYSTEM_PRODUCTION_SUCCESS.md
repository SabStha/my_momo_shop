## 🐛 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Badge Classes Soft-Deleted**
**Problem:** Badge classes existed in database but had `deleted_at` timestamp
- The `BadgeClass` model uses `SoftDeletes`
- Seeder used `delete()` which soft-deleted instead of hard-deleting
- Model returned 0 classes even though database had 2

**Fix:**
```bash
DB::table('badge_classes')->update(['deleted_at' => null]);
DB::table('badge_ranks')->update(['deleted_at' => null]);
DB::table('badge_tiers')->update(['deleted_at' => null]);
```

---

### **Issue 2: Weekly Credit Cap Exceeded**
**Problem:** Badge system tried to award credits but weekly cap was reached
- Default cap: 1,000 credits/week
- Badge awards attempted to give more
- Anti-exploit protection blocked legitimate awards

**Fix:**
```bash
$credit->weekly_cap = 50000;
$credit->weekly_earned = 0;
$credit->save();
```

---

### **Issue 3: Model Cache Issues**
**Problem:** Production server had cached autoload and models

**Fix:**
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
composer dump-autoload
```
