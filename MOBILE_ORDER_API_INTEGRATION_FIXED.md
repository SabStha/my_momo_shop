# 🔧 Mobile Order API Integration - Fixed

## ✅ **Issues Resolved**

### **Problem 1: Orders Not Appearing in Payment Manager**
**Root Cause:** Mobile app was saving orders ONLY to local device storage (AsyncStorage), never sending them to the backend API.

**Solution:** Integrated backend order API so mobile orders are now sent to the server and appear in payment manager.

### **Problem 2: Orders Succeeding When Session Closed**
**Root Cause:** No session validation was happening because orders weren't going through the backend.

**Solution:** Backend API checks for open cash drawer session. Orders are rejected with proper error message when business is closed.

---

## 📋 **Changes Made**

### **1. Created Order API Module** (`amako-shop/src/api/orders.ts`)

New API functions for mobile app:
- `createOrder()` - Send order to backend
- `getUserOrders()` - Fetch user's orders
- `getOrder()` - Get specific order details
- `updateOrderStatus()` - Update order status

**Key Features:**
- Handles business closed errors (HTTP 423)
- Validates session before creating order
- Returns proper error messages
- Logs all API calls for debugging

### **2. Added API Route** (`routes/api.php`)

```php
// Orders API routes (authenticated users)
Route::post('/orders', [OrderController::class, 'store']); // Mobile order creation
Route::get('/orders/{order}', [OrderController::class, 'show']); // Get specific order
```

### **3. Updated Payment Screen** (`amako-shop/app/payment.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only saved to local storage
const orderId = createOrder({
  items: items,
  // ... other data
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Sends to backend API first
const result = await createOrderAPI(orderData);

if (!result.success) {
  if (result.business_status === 'closed') {
    Alert.alert('Business Closed', 'We are currently closed...');
    return;
  }
}

// Also save to local storage for offline access
createOrder({ ... });
```

### **4. Updated Order Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`)

- Added 'amako_credits' to accepted payment methods
- Already has session check (lines 98-108)
- Returns HTTP 423 when business is closed

---

## 🔒 **Session Validation**

### **Backend Check (Automatic)**

When mobile app creates an order:

1. **API receives order request**
2. **Checks for open cash drawer session:**
   ```php
   $cashDrawerSession = CashDrawerSession::where('branch_id', $branchId)
       ->whereNull('closed_at')
       ->first();
   
   if (!$cashDrawerSession) {
       return response()->json([
           'success' => false,
           'message' => 'We are currently closed...',
           'business_status' => 'closed'
       ], 423);
   }
   ```
3. **If closed:** Returns error, order NOT created
4. **If open:** Creates order, sends to payment manager

### **Mobile App Handling**

```typescript
const result = await createOrderAPI(orderData);

if (result.business_status === 'closed') {
  // Show "Business Closed" alert
  // Prevent order creation
  // Keep items in cart
}
```

## 💰 **Amako Credits Payment**

### **Frontend (Mobile App)**
Payment method ID: `'amako_credits'`

### **Backend Mapping**
Mapped to: `'wallet'` payment method

```typescript
payment_method: selectedPaymentMethod === 'amako_credits' ? 'wallet' : selectedPaymentMethod
```

### **Wallet Deduction**
Backend automatically:
1. Checks user's wallet balance
2. Deducts order total from wallet
3. Creates wallet transaction
4. Fails order if insufficient funds

---

## 📱 **Order Flow (New)**

### **1. User Places Order**
```
Cart → Checkout → Branch Selection → Payment Screen
```

### **2. Select Payment Method**
- Amako Credits (💰)
- Cash on Delivery (💵)
- eSewa (📱)
- Khalti (💳)
- FonePay (📲)

### **3. API Call to Backend**
```typescript
POST /api/orders
{
  branch_id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "9841234567",
  city: "Kathmandu",
  payment_method: "wallet", // or "cash", "esewa", etc.
  items: [
    { product_id: "123", quantity: 2 },
    { product_id: "456", quantity: 1 }
  ],
  total: 850.00
}
```

### **4. Backend Validation**
✅ Check cash drawer session (business open?)  
✅ Validate products exist and are active  
✅ Calculate totals (prevent price tampering)  
✅ Check wallet balance (if wallet payment)  
✅ Create order in database  
✅ Create order items  
✅ Deduct from wallet (if applicable)  
✅ Send to payment manager  

### **5. Response to Mobile App**
**Success:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": 1234,
    "order_number": "ORD-ABC123",
    "status": "pending",
    "total": 850.00
  }
}
```

**Business Closed:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "We are currently closed...",
  "business_status": "closed"
}
```

### **6. Show Success/Error**
- **Success:** Show order confirmation modal
- **Closed:** Alert user, keep cart items
- **Error:** Show error message, retry option

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### **Check Order Was Sent to Backend**

**Mobile App Logs:**
```
📦 Sending order to API: { branch_id: 1, items: [...], total: 850 }
✅ Order created successfully: { order_number: "ORD-ABC123" }
```

**Backend Logs:**
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "OrderController@store"
```

### **Check Session Status**

**Query Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cash_drawer_sessions 
WHERE branch_id = 1 
AND closed_at IS NULL;
```

**Expected:**
- **Has rows:** Session is open ✅
- **No rows:** Session is closed ❌

### **Check Order in Database**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE order_type = 'online' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Recommended:**
1. ✅ Test with session open and closed
