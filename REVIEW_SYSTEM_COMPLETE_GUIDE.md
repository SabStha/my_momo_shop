## 🎁 **Review Rewards Breakdown**

### **Credits Calculation:**
```php
$reviewPoints = 10; // Base

if ($rating === 5) {
    $reviewPoints = 25; // 2.5x bonus for 5-star
} elseif ($rating >= 4) {
    $reviewPoints = 15; // 1.5x bonus for 4-star
}
```

### **Why Different Points:**
- **1-3 stars**: Base 10 credits (encourage honest feedback)
- **4 stars**: 15 credits (reward positive reviews)
- **5 stars**: 25 credits (reward excellent reviews)

### **Anti-Gaming Measures:**
- ✅ Only **new reviews** earn points
- ✅ **Updating** a review doesn't earn more points
- ✅ One review per order
- ✅ Weekly credit cap applies (50,000/week)
