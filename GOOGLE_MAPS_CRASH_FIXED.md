# ✅ Google Maps Crash FIXED!

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 **FIXED**  
**Severity:** 🔴 **Critical** - App crashed on ALL map features

---

## 🚨 The Problem

**Crash Log:**
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: API key not found.
Check that <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" 
android:value="your API key"/> is in the <application> element of AndroidManifest.xml
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ App crashed when viewing order tracking maps
- ❌ App crashed when viewing delivery maps  
- ❌ App crashed when viewing store location
- ❌ **100% crash rate** on all map features
- 🔥 **20+ crashes in 30 minutes** in production

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The Google Maps API key was **COMMENTED OUT** in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!-- <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="YOUR_ANDROID_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/> -->
```

Even though the API key was correctly configured in `app.json`, it wasn't being injected into the Android manifest during the EAS build process because:

1. ❌ The line was commented out in the base AndroidManifest.xml
2. ❌ The `react-native-maps` config plugin was missing from `app.json`
3. ❌ EAS build wasn't overwriting the commented line

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Fix #1: Uncommented API Key in AndroidManifest.xml

**File:** `amako-shop/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Before (Line 21):**
```xml
<!-- <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="YOUR_ANDROID_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/> -->
```

**After (Line 21):**
```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="AIzaSyCgas0A0JVwVLZefRXJ-e4qpkam1TdEf2A"/>
```

### Fix #2: Added react-native-maps Config Plugin

**File:** `amako-shop/app.json`

**Added to plugins array (Lines 20-25):**
```json
[
  "react-native-maps",
  {
    "googleMapsApiKey": "AIzaSyCgas0A0JVwVLZefRXJ-e4qpkam1TdEf2A"
  }
]
```

This ensures that:
- ✅ EAS builds automatically inject the API key
- ✅ Future builds won't have commented out keys
- ✅ The key is managed in one central location (app.json)

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Clean Build Artifacts
```bash
cd amako-shop
rm -rf android/build
rm -rf android/app/build
rm -rf android/.gradle
```

### Step 2: Rebuild with EAS
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
```

**Why `--clear-cache`?**
- Ensures EAS uses the updated AndroidManifest.xml
- Clears any cached build artifacts
- Forces a complete rebuild with the new config plugin

### Step 3: Monitor Build
- Go to https://expo.dev
- Watch for "Build finished"
- Download the new APK

### Step 4: Test Maps
After installing the new APK:
1. ✅ Open order tracking
2. ✅ View delivery map
3. ✅ Check store location
4. ✅ Verify no crashes

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After deploying the fix:

- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] APK installs without errors  
- [ ] Order tracking map loads
- [ ] Delivery map displays
- [ ] Store location map works
- [ ] No "API key not found" errors in logs
- [ ] No crashes when viewing maps

---

## 📊 Expected Logs (Success)

**Before Fix (Crashed):**
```
E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main
E/AndroidRuntime: java.lang.IllegalStateException: API key not found
```

**After Fix (Works):**
```
I/Google Maps Android API: Successfully loaded map
D/MapView: Map loaded successfully
I/RNMaps: MapView initialized
```

---

## 🔄 For Future Reference

### Always Include Google Maps Config Plugin

When using `react-native-maps` with Expo, **ALWAYS** add the config plugin:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-maps",
        {
          "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Never Comment Out API Keys in AndroidManifest.xml

If you need to disable maps temporarily:
- ❌ Don't comment out the meta-data tag
- ✅ Remove the `react-native-maps` plugin from app.json
- ✅ Add feature flags in your code

---

## 🎯 Impact

**Before Fix:**
- 🔴 20+ crashes per 30 minutes
- 🔴 100% crash rate on map features
- 🔴 Users couldn't track orders
- 🔴 Users couldn't view store location

**After Fix:**
- 🟢 0 crashes expected
- 🟢 Maps load successfully
- 🟢 Order tracking works
- 🟢 Store location visible
