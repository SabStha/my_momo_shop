# Mobile App Sign-Up Crash Fix

## Problem

The Android APK was crashing when users clicked the "Sign Up" button with correct credentials. The error handling worked correctly (showing "incorrect" for wrong passwords), but successful registration caused the app to crash.

## Root Causes

### 1. User Object Complexity Issue
**Problem:** The registration API was returning `$user->load('roles')` which loads the Spatie Permissions roles relationship. This creates a complex nested object that can cause serialization issues when storing in React Native's SecureStore, especially in production builds.

**Location:** `routes/api.php` line 154

**Before:**
```php
return response()->json([
    'success' => true,
    'token' => $token,
    'user' => $user->load('roles')  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex object with relations
], 201);
```

### 2. Navigation Inconsistency
**Problem:** The `useRegister` hook was navigating to `/(tabs)` while the login flow navigates to `/(tabs)/home`, causing potential routing confusion.

**Location:** `amako-shop/src/api/auth-hooks.ts` line 67

### 3. Lack of Error Handling in Post-Registration Flow
**Problem:** No try-catch around the token storage and navigation logic in the `useRegister` hook, so errors would cause silent crashes.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Simplified User Response (Backend)

Updated both `/auth/register` and `/login` endpoints to return only essential user fields:

```php
// Return simplified user object to avoid serialization issues
$userResponse = [
    'id' => (string)$user->id,
    'name' => $user->name,
    'email' => $user->email,
    'phone' => $user->phone,
];

return response()->json([
    'success' => true,
    'token' => $token,
    'user' => $userResponse  // ‚úÖ Simple, serializable object
], 201);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `routes/api.php` (lines 145-163 for registration, lines 203-220 for login)

### Fix 2: Consistent Navigation (Frontend)

Updated `useRegister` hook to navigate to `/(tabs)/home` instead of `/(tabs)`:

```typescript
// Navigate to main app - using home tab specifically
router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
```

**Files Modified:**
- `amako-shop/src/api/auth-hooks.ts` (line 78)

### Fix 3: Enhanced Error Handling

Added try-catch around the post-registration flow and added comprehensive logging:

```typescript
try {
  // Store token in secure storage
  await setToken({ token: data.token, user: data.user });
  
  // Invalidate and refetch user profile
  await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: authQueryKeys.profile });
  
  // Navigate to main app
  router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('üîê Registration: Error in post-registration flow:', error);
  throw error;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `amako-shop/src/api/auth-hooks.ts` (lines 63-82)
- `amako-shop/app/(auth)/register.tsx` (lines 152-168)

## Why This Crashed in Production

### SecureStore Serialization Issues
React Native's `SecureStore` (used for storing authentication tokens) has limitations with complex objects:

1. **Nested Relationships:** The `$user->load('roles')` creates deeply nested structures
2. **Circular References:** Laravel models can have circular references that break JSON serialization
3. **Production vs Development:** These issues are often masked in development builds but cause crashes in release builds
4. **Large Objects:** Complex Eloquent models with many relations can exceed storage limits

### The Fix Works Because:
- Simple flat objects are easily serializable
- No nested relationships to worry about
- Smaller data footprint
- No circular reference risks
- ID is explicitly cast to string for consistency

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
# On production server
cd /var/www/amako-momo\(p\)/my_momo_shop
git pull origin main
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### 2. Rebuild Mobile App
```bash
cd C:\Users\user\my_momo_shop\amako-shop
eas build --platform android --profile preview --non-interactive
```

### 3. Test Sign-Up Flow
1. Install new APK
2. Open app and go to Sign Up screen
3. Fill in all fields with valid data
4. Click "Sign Up" button
5. **Expected:** App should navigate to home screen successfully
6. **Verify:** User is logged in and can access all features

### 4. Test Login Flow (Should Also Work Better)
1. Log out from the app
2. Go to Login screen
3. Enter credentials
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **Expected:** Smooth navigation to home screen

## Files Changed

### Backend:
1. **routes/api.php** (2 changes)
   - Registration endpoint: Simplified user response
   - Login endpoint: Simplified user response

### Frontend:
2. **amako-shop/src/api/auth-hooks.ts** (1 change)
   - Enhanced `useRegister` hook with better error handling and logging
   - Fixed navigation to `/(tabs)/home`

3. **amako-shop/app/(auth)/register.tsx** (1 change)
   - Added comprehensive logging to registration flow

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

### 1. Always Return Simple API Responses
```php
// ‚úÖ Good - Simple flat object
return response()->json([
    'user' => [
        'id' => $user->id,
        'name' => $user->name,
    ]
]);

// ‚ùå Bad - Complex with relationships
return response()->json([
    'user' => $user->load('roles', 'permissions', 'profile')
]);
```

### 2. Test in Production Builds
- Always test critical flows in release/production builds
- Don't rely solely on development builds
- Use tools like `eas build --profile preview` for testing

### 3. Add Comprehensive Logging
- Log before and after async operations
- Log navigation attempts
- Log storage operations

### 4. Handle Storage Errors
- Wrap SecureStore operations in try-catch
- Provide fallbacks for storage failures
- Clear corrupted data if storage fails

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves:
- Potential login issues with complex user objects
- SecureStore errors in production builds
- Navigation inconsistencies between auth flows

## Status

‚úÖ **Backend API Simplified** - User responses now use flat objects  
‚úÖ **Frontend Navigation Fixed** - Consistent routing to home tab  
‚úÖ **Error Handling Enhanced** - Comprehensive logging and try-catch  
‚è≥ **Testing Required** - Need to rebuild APK and test sign-up flow  

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Run the app in development to verify no breaking changes
2. **Deploy backend** - Push changes to production server
3. **Rebuild APK** - Create new build with fixes
4. **Test sign-up** - Verify successful registration and navigation
5. **Monitor logs** - Check for any new errors in Laravel logs and app console

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing tokens
- No database migrations required
- No breaking changes to the API structure
- User experience should improve with faster token storage
