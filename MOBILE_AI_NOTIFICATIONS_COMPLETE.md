# üîî Mobile AI Notification Integration - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete!**

Your mobile app notification system is now fully integrated with the AI offer generation system. Here's everything that was implemented:

---

## üì¶ **What Was Built**

### **1. MobileNotificationService** (`app/Services/MobileNotificationService.php`)
A comprehensive service for sending notifications to mobile app users with the following features:

#### **Methods Available:**
- `sendOfferNotification()` - Send AI offer to a specific user
- `broadcastOfferToAllUsers()` - Send offer to all users (with audience targeting)
- `sendPersonalizedOffer()` - Send custom personalized offers
- `sendOrderUpdate()` - Send order status notifications
- `sendFlashSaleNotification()` - Broadcast flash sales
- `sendSystemNotification()` - Send system-wide announcements
- `cleanupOldNotifications()` - Clean up old read notifications

### **2. AIOfferService Integration** (`app/Services/AIOfferService.php`)
- Updated to automatically send notifications when AI offers are generated
- Notifications are sent immediately after offer creation
- Target audience filtering supported (new customers, returning customers, all)

### **3. Automated Daily Offers** (`app/Console/Commands/SendDailyAIOffers.php`)
- **Command:** `php artisan offers:send-daily-ai`
- **Schedule:** Runs daily at 10:00 AM automatically
- Generates AI-powered offers based on business data
- Sends notifications to mobile users automatically

### **4. Admin API Endpoints** (`routes/api.php`)
Manual testing and control endpoints for admins:

```
POST /api/admin/mobile-notifications/test
POST /api/admin/mobile-notifications/generate-ai-offers
POST /api/admin/mobile-notifications/flash-sale
POST /api/admin/mobile-notifications/broadcast-offer/{offerId}
GET  /api/admin/mobile-notifications/statistics
```

## üéØ **Notification Types**

Your mobile app now supports these notification types:

| Type | Icon | Use Case | Example |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **promotion** | üéÅ | AI offers, discounts | "20% off weekend special!" |
| **order** | üõí | Order updates | "Your order is ready!" |
| **payment** | üí≥ | Payment confirmations | "Payment received" |
| **system** | ‚öôÔ∏è | App updates, announcements | "New menu items added!" |
| **flash_sale** | ‚ö° | Limited time offers | "2 hours flash sale!" |

---

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Option 1: Automatic Daily Notifications**
The system automatically runs every day at 10 AM:
- Analyzes business data (sales, inventory, customer behavior)
- Generates personalized AI offers using OpenAI
- Sends notifications to mobile users automatically

**No action needed - it's automated!** ‚ú®

### **Option 2: Manual Generation (Admin)**
Generate and send AI offers manually:

```bash
php artisan offers:send-daily-ai
```

### **Option 3: API Endpoints (For Web Dashboard)**
Use the admin endpoints to control notifications from your web dashboard:

**Generate AI Offers:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/admin/mobile-notifications/generate-ai-offers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"branch_id": 1}'
```

**Send Test Notification:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/admin/mobile-notifications/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Send Flash Sale:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/admin/mobile-notifications/flash-sale \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "2 Hours Flash Sale!",
    "message": "Buy 2 get 1 free on all momos!",
    "data": {"discount": 50}
  }'
```

---

## üì± **For Mobile App Users**

When you open the mobile app:

1. **Notification Bell** (top right) shows unread count
2. **Tap the bell** to see all notifications
3. **Notifications include:**
   - üéÅ Special AI-generated offers
   - ‚ö° Flash sales
   - üõí Order updates
   - üéØ Personalized recommendations
   - ‚öôÔ∏è System announcements

4. **Tap any notification** to:
   - View offer details
   - Apply discount codes
   - Navigate to relevant screens
   - Mark as read

---

## üß™ **Testing the System**

### **Create Sample Notifications**
Run the test script to create sample notifications:

```bash
php create_sample_notifications.php
```

This creates 3 notifications for up to 10 users:
- üéÅ Weekend special offer (20% off)
- ‚ö° Flash sale (Buy 2 get 1 free)
- üéâ Welcome message

### **Check Notification Count**
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo DB::table('notifications')->count();"
```

### **View Notifications in Mobile App**
1. Open the Amako Momo mobile app
2. Tap the notification bell (top right)
3. Pull to refresh
4. You should see your notifications!

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: No notifications showing in mobile app**

**Solution 1: Create sample notifications**
```bash
php create_sample_notifications.php
```

**Solution 2: Check if notifications exist**
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Notifications: ' . DB::table('notifications')->count() . PHP_EOL;"
```

**Solution 3: Force refresh in mobile app**
- Pull down on the notifications screen
- This fetches latest notifications from API

### **Issue: AI offers not generating**

**Check 1: OpenAI API Key**
Ensure your `.env` file has a valid OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

**Check 2: Database schema**
The AI offer system needs certain columns. If you see SQL errors about missing columns, those features may need schema updates.

**Check 3: Run command manually**
```bash
php artisan offers:send-daily-ai --verbose
```

### **Issue: Scheduler not running**

The automated daily notifications require Laravel's task scheduler to be running:

**Windows:**
Add this to Task Scheduler to run every minute:
```
php C:\path\to\my_momo_shop\artisan schedule:run
```

**Linux/Mac:**
Add to crontab:
```
* * * * * cd /path/to/my_momo_shop && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## üìä **Monitoring**

### **View Statistics**
```bash
curl -X GET http://your-domain/api/admin/mobile-notifications/statistics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total": 150,
    "unread": 45,
    "read": 105,
    "by_type": [...]
  }
}
```

### **Check Logs**
AI offer generation and notification sending are logged:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Mobile notification"
```
