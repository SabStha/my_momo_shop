## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**File:** `app/Services/MobileNotificationService.php`

1. **Added "delivered" status:**
   ```php
   $statusMessages['delivered'] = 'Your order has been delivered! Hope you enjoy your meal! 😊';
   $statusIcons['delivered'] = '🎉';
   ```

2. **Added special flag for delivered orders:**
   ```php
   'action' => $status === 'delivered' ? 'order_delivered_review' : 'view_order',
   'show_review_prompt' => $status === 'delivered', // Triggers popup
   ```

3. **Fixed delivery dashboard error:**
   - Fixed date parsing in `delivery/dashboard.blade.php`
   - Used `\Carbon\Carbon::parse()` for string dates

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. OrderDeliveredModal Component
**File:** `amako-shop/src/components/modals/OrderDeliveredModal.tsx`

- Beautiful modal with success icon
- Shows order number
- Animated entrance
- Three action buttons
- Close on backdrop tap or X button

#### 2. useOrderDeliveredNotification Hook
**File:** `amako-shop/src/hooks/useOrderDeliveredNotification.ts`

- Listens for delivered notifications
- Tracks which delivered orders were already shown (using AsyncStorage)
- Prevents showing same popup multiple times
- Manages modal states (delivered modal + review modal)

**Key Features:**
- Checks notifications every time they update
- Filters for `status === 'delivered'` and `show_review_prompt === true`
- Stores shown order IDs in AsyncStorage
- Only shows popup once per delivered order

#### 3. OrderDeliveredHandler Component
**File:** `amako-shop/src/components/OrderDeliveredHandler.tsx`

- Wrapper component that uses the hook
- Renders both modals
- Handles review submission to API
- Shows success/error alerts

#### 4. App Layout Integration
**File:** `amako-shop/app/_layout.tsx`

- Added `<OrderDeliveredHandler />` inside QueryProvider
- Ensures hooks have access to React Query

## 📡 Notification Flow

### 1. Order Status Changes to "Delivered"

```php
// In DeliveryController@markAsDelivered
$order->status = 'delivered';
$order->delivered_at = now();
$order->save();

// Send notification
$mobileNotificationService->sendOrderUpdate($order->user, $order, 'delivered');
```

### 2. Notification Stored in Database

```json
{
  "type": "order",
  "title": "🎉 Order Delivered",
  "message": "Your order has been delivered! Hope you enjoy your meal! 😊",
  "data": {
    "order_id": 11,
    "order_number": "ORD-68E96B4E48FC9",
    "status": "delivered",
    "action": "order_delivered_review",
    "show_review_prompt": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Mobile App Detects Notification

```typescript
// useOrderDeliveredNotification hook
useEffect(() => {
  const deliveredNotifications = notifications.filter(n =>
    n.data.status === 'delivered' && n.data.show_review_prompt
  );
  
  if (deliveredNotifications.length > 0) {
    // Show popup!
    setShowDeliveredModal(true);
  }
}, [notifications]);
```

### 4. Popup Appears

- Modal slides in with animation
- User sees order delivered confirmation
- Review prompt displayed

### 5. User Actions

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Write a Review | Opens review form modal |
| View Order | Navigates to `/order/{id}` |
| Close / Tap outside | Dismisses modal |

---

## 🌟 Review Submission Flow

### 1. User Clicks "Write a Review"
- Delivered modal closes
- Review modal opens (300ms delay for smooth transition)

### 2. Review Form
- **Star Rating:** 1-5 stars (required)
- **Order Item:** What they ordered (required, min 5 chars)
- **Comment:** Experience feedback (required, 5-500 chars)
- **Validation:** Shows friendly error modal if incomplete

### 3. Submit Review
- POST to `/api/reviews`
- Success: Shows "Thank You! ⭐" alert
- Error: Shows error message

---

## 🔐 Data Persistence

### AsyncStorage Keys

**`shown_delivered_modals`**: Array of order IDs
```json
["11", "12", "13"]
```

**Purpose:** Prevent showing the same delivered popup multiple times

**Behavior:**
- First time order delivered → Show popup
- User dismisses → Save order ID
- Reopen app → Don't show same popup again
- New order delivered → Show new popup
