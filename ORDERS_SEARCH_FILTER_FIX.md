# Orders Page Search & Filter Fix

## Issues Fixed

The orders page in the mobile app had non-functional search and filter features. Both UI elements were present but didn't actually filter the orders.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Search Functionality
**Problem:** 
- Search input captured text but didn't filter orders
- No clear button to reset search
- Orders displayed were always the full unfiltered list

### 2. Filter Dropdown
**Problem:**
- Filter button was static with no interaction
- No modal or dropdown menu
- Always showed "All Orders" with no way to change it
- No actual filtering by order status

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ 1. Full Search Functionality

**Features Added:**
- Real-time search as you type
- Searches across:
  - Order numbers (e.g., "ORD-123")
  - Order status (e.g., "delivered", "pending")
  - Order amounts (e.g., "500")
- Clear button (X) appears when search has text
- Case-insensitive search
- Results count display

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Filter and search orders using useMemo for performance
const filteredOrders = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = orders;

  // Apply status filter
  if (selectedFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(order => order.status === selectedFilter);
  }

  // Apply search filter
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase().trim();
    filtered = filtered.filter(order => {
      const orderNumber = (order.order_number || `Order #${order.id}`).toLowerCase();
      const status = formatStatus(order.status).toLowerCase();
      const amount = (order.total || order.total_amount || order.grand_total || 0).toString();
      
      return orderNumber.includes(query) || 
             status.includes(query) || 
             amount.includes(query);
    });
  }

  return filtered;
}, [orders, selectedFilter, searchQuery]);
```

### ✅ 2. Full Filter Dropdown Functionality

**Features Added:**
- Interactive dropdown modal (slides up from bottom)
- 8 filter options with icons:
  - 🗂️ All Orders
  - ⏰ Pending
  - ✅ Confirmed
  - 🍽️ Preparing
  - ✔️✔️ Ready
  - 🚴 Out for Delivery
  - ✅ Delivered
  - ❌ Cancelled
- Visual feedback for selected filter (highlighted in blue)
- Checkmark indicator on selected option
- Click outside to close modal
- Updates filter button label to show current selection

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Filter options with icons
const filterOptions: { value: FilterOption; label: string; icon: any }[] = [
  { value: 'all', label: 'All Orders', icon: 'list' },
  { value: 'pending', label: 'Pending', icon: 'time' },
  { value: 'confirmed', label: 'Confirmed', icon: 'checkmark-circle' },
  { value: 'preparing', label: 'Preparing', icon: 'restaurant' },
  { value: 'ready', label: 'Ready', icon: 'checkmark-done' },
  { value: 'out_for_delivery', label: 'Out for Delivery', icon: 'bicycle' },
  { value: 'delivered', label: 'Delivered', icon: 'checkmark-circle' },
  { value: 'cancelled', label: 'Cancelled', icon: 'close-circle' },
];
```

### ✅ 3. Enhanced User Experience Features

**Results Counter:**
- Shows "X orders found" when filters are active
- Displays singular/plural correctly (1 order vs 2 orders)

**Clear Filters Button:**
- Appears when any filter or search is active
- One-click to reset all filters and search

**Better Empty States:**
- Different messages for:
  - No orders at all → "No Orders Yet" with "Start Shopping" button
  - No matching results → "No Orders Found" with "Clear Filters" button

**Search Clear Button:**
- X icon appears in search field when typing
- Quick way to clear search without deleting character by character
