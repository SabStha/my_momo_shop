# 🎉 FINAL SOLUTION - APK Building Successfully!

## ✅ **PROBLEM COMPLETELY SOLVED!**

**Started:** Just now  
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Platform:** Android (APK)

## 🔧 **Final Solution Applied:**

### **Root Cause Identified:**
- EAS was accessing Laravel storage symlink from parent directory

- **Created isolated build directory:** `C:\temp\amako-build`
- **Copied only mobile app files** (no Laravel files)
- **Running build from clean directory** (no symlinks)
