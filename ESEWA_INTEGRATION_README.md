# eSewa Payment Integration

## Overview
This project now includes a fully functional eSewa payment integration for both the React Native mobile app and the Laravel web application.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ React Native App (amako-shop/)
- **WebView Integration**: Opens eSewa payment gateway in a WebView
- **Payment Processing**: Handles success/failure responses
- **Order Creation**: Automatically creates orders after successful payment
- **Status Management**: Shows payment status (pending, success, failed)

### ✅ Laravel Web App
- **Payment Processor**: Full eSewaPaymentProcessor implementation
- **API Integration**: Connects to eSewa test and production APIs
- **Success/Failure Handling**: Dedicated success and failure pages
- **Payment Verification**: Verifies payments with eSewa servers
- **Order Management**: Integrates with existing order system

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# eSewa Configuration
ESEWA_MERCHANT_ID=EPAYTEST
ESEWA_MERCHANT_SECRET=your_secret_here
ESEWA_TEST_MODE=true
```

### Test Mode
- **Test Mode (true)**: Uses eSewa test environment
- **Production Mode (false)**: Uses eSewa production environment

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Initialization
When a user selects eSewa payment:
1. `ESewaPaymentProcessor::initialize()` is called
2. Generates unique transaction ID
3. Creates eSewa payment URL with order details
4. Redirects user to eSewa payment gateway

### 2. Payment Processing
1. User completes payment on eSewa
2. eSewa redirects back to success/failure URLs
3. Payment is verified with eSewa servers
4. Order status is updated accordingly

### 3. Success/Failure Handling
- **Success**: User redirected to `/payment/esewa/success`
- **Failure**: User redirected to `/payment/esewa/failure`
- **Verification**: Payment verified with eSewa API

## API Endpoints

### Payment Routes
- `POST /payments/initialize` - Initialize eSewa payment
- `GET /payment/esewa/success` - Payment success page
- `GET /payment/esewa/failure` - Payment failure page

### Payment Controller
- Supports eSewa in payment method validation
- Automatically redirects to eSewa for eSewa payments
- Handles payment initialization and processing

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run the eSewa payment processor tests:
```bash
php artisan test tests/Unit/ESewaPaymentProcessorTest.php
```

### Manual Testing
1. Select eSewa payment method in checkout
2. Click "Continue to eSewa"
3. Complete payment on eSewa (test mode)
4. Verify redirect to success/failure page
5. Check order status in admin panel

## Integration Points

### Payment Service Provider
- `ESewaPaymentProcessor` registered in `PaymentServiceProvider`
- Automatically selected when payment method is 'esewa'

### Order System
- Integrates with existing `Order` and `Payment` models
- Updates payment status and metadata
- Maintains transaction history

### User Experience
- Seamless payment flow from checkout to completion
- Clear success/failure feedback
- Automatic order processing after payment

## Security Features

### Payment Verification
- All payments verified with eSewa servers
- Transaction IDs logged and tracked
- Payment metadata stored for audit trail

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful failure handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Webhook support for real-time payment updates
- [ ] Payment retry mechanism
- [ ] Advanced fraud detection
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Payment analytics dashboard

### Customization
- [ ] Custom success/failure page designs
- [ ] Payment method preferences
- [ ] Automated payment reminders
- [ ] Integration with accounting systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment Not Redirecting**
   - Check eSewa configuration in `.env`
   - Verify merchant ID and secret
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Payment Verification Fails**
   - Ensure eSewa service is available
   - Check transaction ID format
   - Verify payment amount matches

3. **Order Not Created**
   - Check payment status in database
   - Verify payment verification response
   - Check order creation logic

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in `ESewaPaymentProcessor`:
```php
Log::debug('eSewa payment details', $data);
```

## Support
