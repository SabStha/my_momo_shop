# Payment Manager - Mark as Ready Button Fix

## Problem

The payment manager was missing a button to change order status from "pending/confirmed" to "ready". This prevented staff from updating order status to indicate the order is ready for pickup/delivery.

## Solution

Added "Mark as Ready" button functionality to the payment manager for orders with status `confirmed` or `preparing`.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Order Card Rendering (`public/js/payment-manager.js` lines 1444-1464)

**Before:**
- Only showed "Accept/Decline" buttons for pending orders
- Only showed "Reset to Pending" button for confirmed/declined orders
- ❌ No way to mark confirmed orders as ready

**After:**
```javascript
if (order.status === 'pending') {
    // Show accept/decline buttons
    actionButtons = `...Accept/Decline buttons...`;
} else if (order.status === 'confirmed' || order.status === 'preparing') {
    // Show mark as ready button ✅ NEW!
    actionButtons = `
        <button onclick="markOrderAsReady(${order.id})" 
                class="w-full px-3 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white...">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle mr-1"></i> Mark as Ready
        </button>
    `;
} else if (order.status === 'declined') {
    // Show reset button
    actionButtons = `...Reset button...`;
}
```

### 2. Added JavaScript Function (`public/js/payment-manager.js` lines 2831-2884)

Created `markOrderAsReady()` function that:
- Shows loading state on button click
- Calls backend API endpoint `/admin/orders/{id}/mark-as-ready`
- Updates order status to "ready"
- Shows success/error notifications
- Refreshes order list to reflect changes
- Sends mobile notification to customer

```javascript
function markOrderAsReady(orderId) {
    // Show loading state
    button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-spinner fa-spin mr-1"></i> Marking...';
    
    // Call backend API
    fetch(`/admin/orders/${orderId}/mark-as-ready`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken,
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            showToast('Order marked as ready!', 'success');
            fetchOrders(); // Refresh orders
        } else {
            showToast('Failed to mark order as ready', 'error');
        }
    });
}
```

### 3. Backend Endpoint (Already Existed)

The backend endpoint was already implemented in `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminOrderController.php`:

```php
public function markAsReady(Request $request, $orderId)
{
    $order = Order::findOrFail($orderId);
    
    // Update order status to ready
    $order->status = 'ready';
    $order->ready_at = now();
    $order->save();
    
    // Send mobile notification to customer
    if ($order->user_id) {
        $mobileNotificationService->sendOrderUpdate(
            $order->user,
            $order,
            'ready'
        );
    }
    
    return response()->json([
        'success' => true,
        'message' => 'Order marked as ready'
    ]);
}
```

**Route:** `POST /admin/orders/{orderId}/mark-as-ready`

## Order Status Flow

### Old Flow (Broken):
```
pending → [Accept] → confirmed → ❌ STUCK (no button to mark as ready)
```

### New Flow (Fixed):
```
pending → [Accept] → confirmed → [Mark as Ready] → ready → delivery/pickup
          ↓
      preparing → [Mark as Ready] → ready
```

## Features

### Button Display Logic

| Order Status | Button Displayed | Action |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| `pending` | Accept / Decline | Change to confirmed/declined |
| `confirmed` | **Mark as Ready** ✅ | Change to ready |
| `preparing` | **Mark as Ready** ✅ | Change to ready |
| `ready` | (No button) | Order is ready |
| `delivered` | (No button) | Order complete |
| `declined` | Reset to Pending | Change back to pending |

### User Experience

1. **Staff accepts order** → Status changes to "confirmed"
2. **Order card now shows "Mark as Ready" button** ✅
3. **Staff clicks button** → Button shows spinner "Marking..."
4. **Backend updates status** → Status changes to "ready"
5. **Customer receives notification** 📱 "Your order is ready!"
6. **Order list refreshes** → Order card updates automatically

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Accept a pending order → Should show "Mark as Ready" button
- [x] Click "Mark as Ready" → Button shows loading spinner
- [x] Order status updates → Changes to "ready"
- [x] Success notification → Toast appears "Order marked as ready!"
- [x] Order list refreshes → Shows updated status
- [x] Customer notification → Mobile app receives "ready" notification
- [x] Error handling → Shows error if API call fails

---

## Files Modified

1. **`public/js/payment-manager.js`**
   - Line 1444-1464: Added "Mark as Ready" button for confirmed/preparing orders
   - Line 2831-2884: Added `markOrderAsReady()` function

---

## Notes

- The backend endpoint was already implemented, just needed frontend button
- Button only shows for online orders (not POS/dine-in)
- Mobile notifications are automatically sent when order is marked ready
- Order automatically refreshes in payment manager after status update

---

## Quick Test

1. Open payment manager: `/admin/payments`
2. Create a mobile order (or use existing pending order)
3. Click "Accept" on the order
4. **You should now see "Mark as Ready" button** ✅
5. Click the button
6. Order status changes to "ready"
7. Customer receives notification on mobile app

Done! 🎉
