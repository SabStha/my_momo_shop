## ‚úÖ What I've Created for You

I've created **3 versions** of your Privacy Policy:

1. **üìÑ Markdown Version** - `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
   - Full detailed policy
   - Easy to read and edit
   - Can be converted to PDF

2. **üåê HTML Version** - `privacy-policy.html`
   - Standalone HTML file
   - Beautiful, responsive design
   - Can be uploaded to any web server

   - Matches your site design
   - Already has route configured

## üöÄ How to Use

```
Privacy Policy URL: https://your-production-domain.com/privacy-policy
```

### Option 2: Upload HTML File to Your Server

1. Upload `privacy-policy.html` to your web server
