# Login Fix Summary

## Problem
Getting error: **"The email field is required"** even though the email field was filled.

## Root Cause
The React Native app was sending field name **`emailOrPhone`** but the Laravel API expects **`email`**.

### What was happening:
```json
// React Native was sending:
{
  "emailOrPhone": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

// Laravel was expecting:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Laravel validation rule was checking for `email` field, but receiving `emailOrPhone`, so it returned validation error.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

Modified `amako-shop/src/api/auth.ts` to transform the field names before sending to Laravel:

### Login Function
```typescript
// Transform emailOrPhone to email for Laravel API
const requestData = {
  email: credentials.emailOrPhone,
  password: credentials.password,
};
```

### Register Function
```typescript
// Transform emailOrPhone to email for Laravel API
const requestData = {
  name: credentials.name,
  email: credentials.emailOrPhone,
  password: credentials.password,
  password_confirmation: credentials.password_confirmation,
};
```

## Testing
1. **Reload your app** (it should hot-reload automatically)
2. **Try logging in** - it should work now! ‚úÖ
3. **Check the logs** - you'll see: `üîê Login: Sending data: { email: "your-email@example.com", password: "[HIDDEN]" }`

## Why This Happened
- The UI was designed to accept both email and phone (flexibility)
- The API was designed to accept only email (Laravel standard)
- The field name transformation was missing

## Future Considerations
If you want to support **both email AND phone login**:
1. Update Laravel validation to accept either field
2. Add logic to determine if input is email or phone
3. Send to appropriate field based on detection

Example logic:
```typescript
const isEmail = credentials.emailOrPhone.includes('@');
const requestData = isEmail 
  ? { email: credentials.emailOrPhone, password: credentials.password }
  : { phone: credentials.emailOrPhone, password: credentials.password };
```

But for now, the email-only fix should work! üéâ
