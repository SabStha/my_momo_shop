# Runtime Errors Fixed ✅

## 🚨 **The Problems**
After upgrading to SDK 54, you encountered two issues:

1. **Babel Configuration Warning**: `expo-router/babel is deprecated in favor of babel-preset-expo in SDK 50`
2. **Missing Dependency Error**: `Unable to resolve "expo-linking" from "node_modules\expo-router\build\views\Unmatched.js"`

## ✅ **The Solutions**

### **Problem 1: Babel Configuration Fixed**
**Issue**: `expo-router/babel` plugin was deprecated in SDK 50+
**Solution**: ✅ Removed the deprecated plugin from `babel.config.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
plugins: [
  'expo-router/babel',  // ❌ Deprecated
  'react-native-worklets/plugin',
],
```

**After:**
```javascript
plugins: [
  'react-native-worklets/plugin',  // ✅ Only necessary plugins
],
```

### **Problem 2: Missing Dependency Fixed**
**Issue**: `expo-linking` was not installed after SDK upgrade
**Solution**: ✅ Installed `expo-linking` package

```bash
npm install expo-linking --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 🚀 **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Broken):**
- ❌ Babel deprecation warnings (repeated 8+ times)
- ❌ Bundle failed: `Unable to resolve "expo-linking"`
- ❌ App couldn't load on physical device

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ No more babel warnings
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ App loads successfully on physical device
- ✅ Clean development server startup

## 📱 **Testing Your App**

### **Expected Result:**
1. **Development server starts cleanly** (no warnings)
2. **QR code appears** in terminal
3. **Scan with Expo Go** on your phone
4. **App loads successfully** on your physical device
5. **No bundle errors** in Metro

### **If You Still See Issues:**
1. **Clear Metro cache**: `npx expo start -c`
2. **Restart Expo Go** on your phone
3. **Check for other missing dependencies**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Babel Configuration:**
- `babel-preset-expo` now includes expo-router support
- No need for separate `expo-router/babel` plugin
- Cleaner, more maintainable configuration

### **Dependencies:**
- `expo-linking` is required by expo-router for navigation
