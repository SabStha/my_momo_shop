## Future API Integration

### When Referrals System is Built:

Create API endpoint: `GET /api/referrals/stats`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "total_referrals": 5,
  "successful_referrals": 3,
  "total_earnings": 750,
  "referral_code": "AMAKO1"
}
```

Then update component to use:
```typescript
const { data: referralStats } = useReferralStats();

<Text>{referralStats?.total_referrals || 0}</Text>
<Text>{referralStats?.successful_referrals || 0}</Text>
<Text>Rs {referralStats?.total_earnings || 0}</Text>
```

### When Orders System is Active:

Orders will automatically populate from existing `/api/orders` endpoint.

### When Address System is Enhanced:

If you want multiple addresses (not just profile address), create:
- `addresses` table
- API endpoint to fetch user addresses
- Update component to fetch from API
