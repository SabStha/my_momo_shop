# AmaKo Shop - Current Status & Next Steps

## ✅ **Issues Successfully Fixed**

1. **SessionProvider Context Error** - ✅ Fixed
   - Moved store usage from tabs layout to component level
   - All components now properly wrapped in SessionProvider

2. **Missing Dependencies** - ✅ Fixed
   - Added expo-dev-client to package.json
   - All dependencies reinstalled and verified

3. **App Configuration** - ✅ Fixed
   - Updated app.json with proper plugins
   - Added expo-router and expo-dev-client
   - Configured EAS build profiles

4. **Cache Issues** - ✅ Fixed
   - Cleared Expo and Metro caches
   - Reinstalled all dependencies

## 🔍 **Remaining Issues to Investigate**

### **Issue 1: Radius Property Error**
- **Status**: Partially resolved
- **Problem**: `ReferenceError: Property 'radius' doesn't exist`
- **Investigation**: 
  - ✅ radius is properly exported from tokens.ts
  - ✅ UI index properly exports tokens
  - ✅ All imports look correct
  - 🔍 May be a runtime/bundling issue

### **Issue 2: React.Fragment Style Warning**
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Problem**: `Invalid prop 'style' supplied to React.Fragment`
- **Investigation**: 
  - ✅ No obvious style props on fragments found
  - 🔍 May be in third-party components or dynamic rendering

### **Issue 3: Missing Default Export Warning**
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Problem**: `Route "./_layout.tsx" is missing the required default export`
- **Investigation**: 
  - ✅ All layout files have proper default exports
  - 🔍 May be a bundling or cache issue

## 📱 **Current Testing Status**

### **Expo Go (Current)**
- ✅ Basic app functionality works
- ✅ Navigation between screens works
- ✅ Cart and order functionality works
- ❌ Push notifications don't work (SDK 53 limitation)
- ⚠️ Some runtime errors still present

### **Development Build (Required for Full Testing)**
- 🔄 Ready to build
- ✅ Configuration complete
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- 🎯 Will resolve all runtime issues

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Current Fixes**
```bash
# The development server should now be running with --clear
# Test the app to see if radius errors are resolved
```

### **Step 2: If Issues Persist**
```bash
# Try alternative start methods
npx expo start --tunnel
# or
npx expo start --localhost
```

### **Step 3: Build Development Version**
```bash
# For full functionality (push notifications)
node scripts/build-dev.mjs
```

## 🔧 **Technical Analysis**

### **Radius Import Chain**
```
app/(tabs)/profile.tsx 
  → imports from '../../src/ui/tokens'
  → tokens.ts exports radius
  → UI index re-exports tokens
  → Should work correctly
```

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Metro Bundler Issue**: TypeScript compilation vs runtime
2. **Circular Dependency**: Hidden circular import somewhere
3. **Cache Issue**: Old cached version still in memory
4. **Platform Specific**: Android vs iOS bundling differences

## 📊 **Error Priority**

| Error | Priority | Impact | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| radius property | 🔴 High | App crashes | 🔍 Investigating |
| Fragment style | 🟡 Medium | Warnings only | 🔍 Investigating |
| Default export | 🟡 Medium | Warnings only | 🔍 Investigating |
| Push notifications | 🟢 Low | Expected in Expo Go | ✅ Working as designed |

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Short Term (Today)**
- [ ] radius property error resolved
- [ ] Fragment style warning resolved
- [ ] Default export warning resolved
- [ ] App runs without critical errors

### **Medium Term (This Week)**
- [ ] Development build created
- [ ] Push notifications working
- [ ] Full functionality tested
- [ ] Ready for backend integration

### **Long Term (Next Week)**
- [ ] Backend notification endpoints implemented
- [ ] End-to-end testing complete
- [ ] Play Store submission ready

## 📞 **Support & Debugging**

### **If Radius Error Persists**
1. Check Metro bundler logs
2. Verify TypeScript compilation
3. Test with explicit import path
4. Check for circular dependencies

### **If Fragment Warning Persists**
1. Search for dynamic style props
2. Check third-party components
3. Review conditional rendering
4. Test with React DevTools

### **General Debugging**
1. Use `console.log` to trace imports
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Monitor Metro bundler output
4. Test on different devices/emulators
