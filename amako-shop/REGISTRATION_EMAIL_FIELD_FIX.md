# Registration Email Field Error - Fix Summary

## Problem

When users tried to sign up from the registration page, they received an error saying "email field is required" even though they had filled in the email field.

## Root Cause

**Field Name Mismatch**: The frontend and backend were using different field names for the email/phone input.

### Backend Expectation (`routes/api.php` line 93):
```php
Route::post('/auth/register', function (Request $request) {
    $request->validate([
        'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'emailOrPhone' => 'required|string|max:255',  // <-- Expects 'emailOrPhone'
        'password' => 'required|string|min:8|confirmed',
    ]);
```

### Frontend Was Sending (`amako-shop/src/api/auth.ts` line 95):
```typescript
const requestData = {
  name: credentials.name,
  email: credentials.emailOrPhone,  // <-- Sent as 'email' ‚ùå
  password: credentials.password,
  password_confirmation: credentials.password_confirmation,
};
```

**Result**: Laravel validation failed because it was looking for `emailOrPhone` field but received `email` field instead.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Field Name in API Call

**File**: `amako-shop/src/api/auth.ts`

**Changed**:
```typescript
const requestData = {
  name: credentials.name,
  emailOrPhone: credentials.emailOrPhone,  // ‚úÖ Correct field name
  password: credentials.password,
  password_confirmation: credentials.password_confirmation,
};
```

### 2. Fixed Password Length Validation

**File**: `amako-shop/app/(auth)/register.tsx`

**Issue**: Frontend was checking for minimum 6 characters, but backend requires 8.

**Changed**:
```typescript
// Before
if (password.length < 6) {
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Password must be at least 6 characters');
  return;
}

// After ‚úÖ
if (password.length < 8) {
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Password must be at least 8 characters');
  return;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`amako-shop/src/api/auth.ts`**
   - Changed `email` ‚Üí `emailOrPhone` in request payload
   - Updated debug log to show correct field name

2. **`amako-shop/app/(auth)/register.tsx`**
   - Updated password minimum length from 6 to 8 characters
   - Error message now matches backend validation

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Clear App Data** (important for testing fresh):
   ```bash
   # On Android
   Settings > Apps > Expo Go > Storage > Clear Data
   ```

2. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd amako-shop
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Test Registration**:
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to Sign Up page
   - Fill in all fields:
     - Name: "Test User"
     - Email or Phone: "test@example.com" or "9841234567"
     - Password: "password123" (at least 8 characters)
     - Confirm Password: "password123"
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Should successfully register and log in ‚úÖ

## Related Backend Validation

The Laravel backend validates registration with these rules:

| Field | Validation Rule | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| `name` | `required\|string\|max:255` | User's full name |
| `emailOrPhone` | `required\|string\|max:255` | Email or phone number |
| `password` | `required\|string\|min:8\|confirmed` | Password (minimum 8 chars) |
| `password_confirmation` | (implicit) | Must match password field |

## Why This Happened

This mismatch occurred because:
1. The login endpoint uses `email` field (for backward compatibility)
2. The register endpoint uses `emailOrPhone` field (more flexible)
3. The frontend was incorrectly transforming `emailOrPhone` to `email` for registration

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
- ‚úÖ Always check backend validation rules when implementing forms
- ‚úÖ Use consistent field names between frontend and backend
- ‚úÖ Add debug logging to see exact request payloads
- ‚úÖ Test error cases, not just happy paths

## Debug Logs

When running in development mode (`__DEV__`), you'll see:

**Before registration attempt:**
```
üîê Register: Sending data: {
  name: "Test User",
  emailOrPhone: "test@example.com",
  password: "[HIDDEN]",
  password_confirmation: "[HIDDEN]"
}
```

**On success:**
```
üîê Register API Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "token": "...",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

## Impact

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Email field validation error resolved
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Password length validation now matches backend (8 characters)
‚úÖ **Improved**: Better alignment between frontend and backend validation
‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Clearer error messages for users
