# Network Debug Icon - How to Hide/Show

## What Changed ✅

The persistent debug banner at the top showing:
```
🌐 Connected to: 192.168.2.145
Tap to change network
```

Has been replaced with:
- 🌐 A **small globe icon** in the bottom-right corner
- Only visible in development mode
- Tap it to see network options or change networks

## Current Setup

### What You'll See Now:
- **Small 🌐 icon** - Bottom right corner (above tab bar)
- **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't block your view
- **Tap to use** - Shows network options when you need them

### To Change Networks:
1. Tap the 🌐 icon in bottom-right
2. Choose from:
   - Auto Detect
   - WiFi (192.168.0.19)
   - VirtualBox (192.168.56.1)
   - Cancel

## Want to Hide It Completely?

If you want to remove the debug icon entirely, you have 3 options:

### Option 1: Comment Out the Debug Icon (Easiest)
Edit: `amako-shop/src/components/NetworkDetector.tsx`

Change line 104 from:
```typescript
{__DEV__ && (
```
To:
```typescript
{false && __DEV__ && (
```

### Option 2: Remove the Entire Debug Block
Delete lines 104-112 in `NetworkDetector.tsx`:
```typescript
{__DEV__ && (
  <TouchableOpacity 
    style={styles.debugIcon} 
    onPress={showNetworkOptions}
    activeOpacity={0.7}
  >
    <Text style={styles.debugIconText}>🌐</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

### Option 3: Only Show in Production Builds
The icon only shows in **development mode** (`__DEV__`).

When you build for production (release APK/IPA), it will automatically disappear!

## Why Keep It?

The debug icon is useful for:
- ✅ Quickly switching networks (home ↔ office)
- ✅ Checking which IP you're connected to
- ✅ Testing different network configurations
- ✅ Troubleshooting connection issues

But now it's **much less intrusive** - just a small icon you can ignore! 🎉

## Summary

**Before:** 
- Large banner at top blocking content ❌
- Always showing text ❌
- Annoying! ❌

**After:**
- Small icon in corner ✅
- Out of the way ✅
- Tap only when needed ✅

Much better! 🚀
