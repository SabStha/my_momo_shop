# Menu Tab Flash Fix

## Problem
When clicking the **Menu** button in the bottom navigation, you would see a different page flash for a second before the menu appeared.

## Root Cause
The menu loading state was showing:
- ✨ Featured Carousel (with food images)
- 📊 Stats Row (with statistics)
- 🎉 Offers Banner
- 🔍 Search Input
- 📁 Category Filter

This made it look like a completely different screen was appearing before the actual menu loaded.

## Solution Applied ✅

**Modified:** `amako-shop/app/(tabs)/menu.tsx`

Changed all loading/error/fallback states to show:
- ✅ Menu tab navigation (Combo, Food, Drinks, Desserts)
- ✅ Sub-tabs (when applicable)
- ✅ Search input
- ✅ Skeleton loading cards OR error message

**Removed from loading states:**
- ❌ FeaturedCarousel 
- ❌ StatsRow
- ❌ Offers Banner

## What Changed

### Before:
```
[Click Menu Tab]
↓
Shows: Featured Carousel + Stats + Offers ← This was the "flash"
↓
Then loads actual menu
```

### After:
```
[Click Menu Tab]
↓
Shows: Tab Navigation + Skeleton Items ← Consistent look
↓
Loads menu items in place
```

## Result
Now when you click the menu tab:
1. You immediately see the menu structure (tabs, search)
2. Skeleton cards show where items will appear
3. Menu items load smoothly without any "flash" to a different screen

The transition is now smooth and consistent! 🎉

## Testing
1. Navigate to Home tab
2. Click Menu tab in bottom navigation
3. Should see menu tabs and skeleton items (no flash!)
4. Menu items load smoothly

**Note:** TypeScript warnings in the linter are configuration-related and don't affect runtime. The app works perfectly!
