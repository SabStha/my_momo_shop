# ✅ Custom loading.gif Now Shows on Pull-to-Refresh!

## 🎉 You Were Right!

You asked: "Should I not be seeing my loading.gif when refreshing?"

**Answer: YES, you should!** And now you will! 🎨

---

## ✨ What I Changed

### Before
When you swiped down to refresh:
- ❌ Only saw native OS spinner (tiny, at the very top)
- ❌ Your custom loading.gif didn't show
- ❌ Not your branding

### After
When you swipe down to refresh:
- ✅ **Your custom loading.gif shows!** 🎉
- ✅ Big, beautiful animation in the center
- ✅ "Refreshing..." text below it
- ✅ Shows for at least 800ms so you can see it
- ✅ Still has native pull-to-refresh feel

## 🔧 How It Works Now

When you pull down to refresh:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   (You swipe down)              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│     [Your loading.gif]          │  ← Your custom animation!
│     Refreshing...               │  ← Custom text
│                                 │
│   [Content appears below]       │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Both happen:**
1. Native pull-to-refresh indicator (small, at top edge)
2. **Your custom LoadingSpinner with loading.gif** (big, in content area)

### On Pull-to-Refresh
```

├────────────────────────────────┤

│    🌀 [loading.gif]            │  ← Your custom!

## 💡 Technical Details

### What Changed
I added a dynamic item to the FlatList:

```tsx
const homeData = [
  ...(refreshing ? [{ id: '0', type: 'loading' }] : []), // ← NEW!
  { id: '1', type: 'hero' },
  { id: '2', type: 'kpi' },
  ...
];
```

**When refreshing:**
- Adds a special "loading" item at the top
- Shows your LoadingSpinner component
- Uses your loading.gif animation
- Displays "Refreshing..." text

**When not refreshing:**
- No loading item
- Normal content shows

### Minimum Display Time
Your loading.gif will show for **at least 800ms**:
- Even if data loads instantly (from cache)
- You'll actually see your animation!
- Better user feedback

## 🎨 Comparison

### Other Apps Using Native Spinner
```
