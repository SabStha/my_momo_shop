# 🧪 Beta Testing - Quick Start

## 🎯 Goal

Distribute your AmaKo Momo Shop app to testers before Google Play Store launch.

## ⚡ Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Build the APK (Choose One Method)

#### **Method A: Use the Build Script** ⭐ EASIEST

```bash
cd amako-shop
build-beta.bat
```

This script will:
- Check if EAS CLI is installed
- Log you into Expo
- Build the APK automatically
- Give you a download link

**Time:** 20-30 minutes (mostly waiting)

---

#### **Method B: Manual EAS Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI (if needed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# Navigate to app
cd C:\Users\user\my_momo_shop\amako-shop

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Initialize (first time only)
eas init

# Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**Time:** 20-30 minutes (mostly waiting)

---

#### **Method C: Quick Local Build** (Advanced)

```bash
cd amako-shop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Export for Android
npx expo export:android

# Or use prebuild
npx expo prebuild --platform android
# Then open in Android Studio
```

**Time:** 30-60 minutes (requires Android Studio)

---

### Step 2: Host the APK

```bash
# 1. Create downloads folder (if not exists)
mkdir public\downloads

# 2. Copy your built APK
# Download the APK from EAS build link, then:
copy Downloads\amako-shop-*.apk public\downloads\amako-shop-beta.apk

# 3. Verify it's accessible
# Open browser: http://localhost:8000/downloads/amako-shop-beta.apk
```
