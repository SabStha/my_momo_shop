## 🔄 **Order Status Flow**

### **Complete Lifecycle:**

```

3. preparing        → Kitchen starts cooking (AUTO)
         ↓
4. ready            → Food ready, waiting for driver
         ↓
5. out_for_delivery → Driver accepted, on the way
         ↓
6. delivered        → Delivered with photo proof
```
