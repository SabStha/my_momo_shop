# ✅ Backend Setup Complete!

## What Was Done

### Laravel Backend:

1. ✅ **Added upload method** to `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController.php`
   - Method: `updateProfilePicture()`
   - Handles image upload
   - Deletes old profile picture
   - Stores new picture
   - Updates user record

2. ✅ **Added API route** to `routes/api.php`
   - Route: `POST /api/profile/update-picture`
   - Protected by `auth:sanctum` middleware
   - Uses `UserController@updateProfilePicture`

3. ✅ **Created storage directory**
   - Path: `storage/app/public/profile-pictures/`
   - Ready to store uploaded images

4. ✅ **Storage link** already exists
   - Link: `public/storage -> storage/app/public`
   - Images accessible via URL

## 🧪 Test It Now!

### 1. Make sure Laravel server is running:
```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public
```

### 2. Open your app and go to Profile tab

### 3. Tap the camera icon on your profile picture

### 4. Choose:
- 📸 **Take Photo** - Use camera
- 🖼️ **Choose from Gallery** - Select photo

### 5. Watch it upload! ✨

## 📊 What Happens:

1. **User taps camera icon** → App shows options
2. **User selects image** → Cropped to square
3. **App uploads** → Shows loading (hourglass icon)
4. **Laravel receives** → Validates image (JPEG/PNG/JPG, max 5MB)
5. **Laravel deletes old** → Removes previous profile picture
6. **Laravel stores new** → Saves to `storage/app/public/profile-pictures/`
7. **Laravel updates DB** → Sets `profile_picture` URL on user
8. **Laravel responds** → Returns success with new URL
9. **App refreshes** → Shows new profile picture immediately!

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Laravel logs:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

You'll see:
```
📸 Profile picture upload started
📸 Old profile picture deleted
📸 New profile picture stored

```

### Check uploaded files:
```bash
ls storage/app/public/profile-pictures/
```
