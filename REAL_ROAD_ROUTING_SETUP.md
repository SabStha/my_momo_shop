# 🛣️ Real Road Routing Setup

## **✅ What's Added:**

1. **Google Directions API Integration**: Gets real road routes
2. **Polyline Decoding**: Converts Google's encoded route to coordinates
3. **Real Street Routing**: Route follows actual roads, not straight lines
4. **Fallback System**: Uses simple route if API fails

---

## **🚀 Test Real Road Routing:**

### **Step 1: Create Test Data with Different Locations**

Run this on your server to create locations that are far enough apart to see real road routing:

```bash
cd /var/www/amako-momo\(p\)/my_momo_shop
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Create order with delivery location far from driver
$order = \App\Models\Order::find(5);
if ($order) {
    // Update delivery address to be in different area of Fukuoka
    $order->delivery_address = json_encode([
        'city' => 'Fukuoka',
        'area_locality' => 'Tenjin District',
        'latitude' => '33.5939',  // Tenjin area (different from Hakata Station)
        'longitude' => '130.4011'
    ]);
    $order->save();
    
    echo "Updated delivery address to Tenjin area\n";
}

// Clear old tracking and create driver at Hakata Station
\App\Models\DeliveryTracking::where('order_id', 5)->delete();

\App\Models\DeliveryTracking::create([
    'order_id' => 5,
    'driver_id' => 1,
    'status' => 'location_update',
    'latitude' => '33.5904', // Hakata Station
    'longitude' => '130.4017',
    'notes' => 'Driver at Hakata Station'
]);

echo "Created driver location at Hakata Station\n";
echo "Delivery location: Tenjin area\n";
echo "Distance: ~400m - should show real road route\n";

exit
```

## **📱 What You'll See:**

### **Real Road Route:**
- **Blue line follows actual streets** in Fukuoka
- **Turns at intersections** like real driving
- **Follows one-way streets** and road rules
- **Realistic path** instead of straight line

### **Driver Movement:**
- **Driver marker moves along roads**
- **Follows traffic patterns**
- **Realistic turns and curves**

---

## **🔧 How It Works:**

### **Google Directions API:**
1. **Sends request** to Google with driver and delivery coordinates
2. **Gets real route** with turn-by-turn directions
3. **Decodes polyline** to get detailed coordinates
4. **Draws route** following actual streets

### **API Request:**
```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?
origin=33.5904,130.4017&
destination=33.5939,130.4011&
mode=driving&
key=AIzaSyCgas0A0JVwVLZefRXJ-e4qpkam1TdEf2A
```

### **Route Features:**
- **Real street names** and intersections
- **Traffic-aware routing** (if enabled)
- **Multiple route options** (fastest, shortest)
- **Turn-by-turn instructions**

---

## **🎯 Expected Result:**

Instead of seeing:
- ❌ **Straight line** through buildings
- ❌ **Route in the air** above houses

You'll see:
- ✅ **Blue line following streets**
- ✅ **Realistic turns and curves**
- ✅ **Route that cars can actually drive**
- ✅ **Professional delivery app look**

---

## **🚴 Test Driver Movement:**

```php
// Create movement along the real route
$routePoints = [
    ['lat' => 33.5904, 'lng' => 130.4017, 'note' => 'Starting at Hakata Station'],
    ['lat' => 33.5910, 'lng' => 130.4015, 'note' => 'Turning onto main street'],
    ['lat' => 33.5920, 'lng' => 130.4013, 'note' => 'Following road to Tenjin'],
    ['lat' => 33.5930, 'lng' => 130.4012, 'note' => 'Approaching Tenjin area'],
    ['lat' => 33.5939, 'lng' => 130.4011, 'note' => 'Arrived at delivery location'],
];

foreach ($routePoints as $point) {
    \App\Models\DeliveryTracking::create([
        'order_id' => 5,
        'driver_id' => 1,
        'status' => 'location_update',
        'latitude' => $point['lat'],
        'longitude' => $point['lng'],
        'notes' => $point['note']
    ]);
}

echo "Created realistic movement along roads\n";
```

**Refresh your app and you should now see the blue route line following actual streets in Fukuoka, just like Uber Eats!** 🛣️✨
