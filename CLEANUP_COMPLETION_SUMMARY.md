"

git tag cleanup-complete-20251008
```

### 2. Clean Up Temporary Scripts (Optional)
```bash
# After verifying everything works, you can remove cleanup scripts:
rm cleanup_database.sql
rm delete_test_users.php
rm execute_cleanup.php
rm verify_cleanup.php
```

### 3. Test the Application
```bash
# Start Laravel server
php artisan serve

# In another terminal, start React Native
cd amako-shop
npm start

# Test key functionality:
# - Login with real user (sabstha98@gmail.com)
# - Browse menu (should load 51 products)
# - Check product prices (should show 13% tax)
# - Try creating a test order
# - Verify no mock data appears
```

### 4. Update .env for Production
Ensure your `.env` has production-ready settings:
```bash
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_TAX_RATE=0.13
TAX_INCLUDED_IN_PRICES=false
APP_CURRENCY=NPR
```

php artisan migrate:status
```

### Restore Code
```bash
# Find cleanup checkpoint
git log --oneline | grep -i checkpoint
git tag -l "cleanup-*"
