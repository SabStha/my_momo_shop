# 🔔 Push Notifications - COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your app now has **full push notification support**! When AI generates offers, users will receive **native push notifications** on their phones.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Backend (Laravel)**
```
1. AI generates offer for user
   ↓
2. MobileNotificationService called
   ↓
3. Saves to database (in-app notifications)
   ↓
4. Gets user's device tokens
   ↓
5. Sends push notification via Expo
   ↓
6. User's phone receives notification! 📱
```

### **Frontend (React Native)**
```
1. App starts
   ↓
2. Requests notification permissions
   ↓
3. Gets Expo Push Token
   ↓
4. Registers token with backend
   ↓
5. Listens for incoming notifications
   ↓
6. Shows notification in system tray! 🔔
```

## 📱 What Users Will See

### **When Offer is Generated:**

**Phone Notification Center:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  🥟 AmaKo Momo              10:30 AM │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  🎉 Flash Sale - Limited Time!   │
│  Get 20% OFF on your next order. │
│  Exclusive discount just for you!│
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When Tapped:**
- App opens → Navigates to Notifications tab
- User sees offer → Can claim it
- Offer added to My Offers

## 📊 Notification Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Flash Sale Offer**
```
Backend:
  php artisan offers:process-triggers
  → Generates flash sale for user
  → Sends push notification
  
User's Phone:
  🔔 Vibrates
  📱 Notification appears in tray
  "Flash Sale - Limited Time! 20% OFF"
  
User taps notification:
  → App opens
  → Goes to Notifications tab
  → Can claim offer
```

### **Example 2: Win-Back Offer (Inactive User)**
```
Backend (Automated):
  Cron job runs daily
  → Detects user inactive 14 days
  → Generates win-back offer
  → Sends push notification
  
User's Phone:
  🔔 "We Miss You! 20% OFF to Come Back"
  
User taps:
  → App opens
  → Shows offer
  → Can claim and order
```

## 🎨 Customization

### **Notification Icon**
Create `amako-shop/assets/notification-icon.png` (white icon, transparent background, 96x96px)

### **Notification Sound**
Create `amako-shop/assets/sounds/notification.wav` (optional custom sound)

### **Notification Color**
Change in `app.json`:
```json
"color": "#FF6B35"  // Your brand orange color
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: No Push Token Generated**
**Solution:** Make sure you're testing on a **physical device**, not emulator

### **Issue 2: Permissions Denied**
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Uninstall and reinstall app
adb uninstall com.amako.shop
npx expo run:android
```

### **Issue 3: Notifications Not Appearing**
**Check:**
- Is device token registered? (check `devices` table in database)
- Are push notifications enabled in phone settings?
- Is app in foreground or background?

### **Issue 4: "EAS Project ID not found"**
**Solution:** Already set in `app.json` line 28 ✅
