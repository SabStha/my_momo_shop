# 🚀 START HERE - APK Crash Fix Complete!

**Date:** October 20, 2025

## ⚡ Quick Summary

Your Android APK was crashing after login due to:

2. ❌ Token not ready when API calls fired
3. ❌ Auto-logout after 3 errors (too aggressive)

**ALL FIXED!** ✅

| Issue | Fix Applied | File |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Pre-login 401 errors | Added auth checks | `useNotifications.ts` |
| Token race condition | 500ms delay | `auth-hooks.ts` |
| Login 401s counting | Ignore during login | `client.ts` |
| Premature logout | Threshold 3→5 | `client.ts` |
| Counter not reset | Reset on init | `SessionProvider.tsx` |

**Total:** 4 files, ~60 lines changed

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### Step 1: Test in Development (5-10 minutes)
```bash
cd amako-shop
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Then open app and login. You should see:
```
✅ NO 401 errors before login
✅ 🔐 Login in progress: true
✅ 🔐 401 counter reset
✅ 🔐 Login in progress: false
✅ ✅ Cart loaded from server
✅ 📱 Notifications loaded
```

**If you see those ✅** → Proceed to Step 2  
**If you see ❌ errors** → Read `BEFORE_AFTER_FIX.md` for debugging

---

### Step 2: Run Full Test Suite (10 minutes)

Open and follow: **`PRE_BUILD_FINAL_TEST.md`**

This has 5 tests:
1. Cold start (no saved token)
2. Login flow
3. App restart with token
4. Rapid tab switching
5. Background/foreground

**Pass all 5?** → Proceed to Step 3  
**Any failures?** → Report in issue

---

### Step 3: Build APK (15-20 minutes)

```bash
# Easy way:
build-apk.bat

# Manual way:
cd amako-shop
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

Monitor at: https://expo.dev/accounts/sabstha98/projects/amako-shop/builds

Wait for **"FINISHED"** status, then download APK.

---

### Step 4: Test on Device (5 minutes)

```bash
# Easy way:
test-apk-install.bat

# Manual way:
adb install -r path/to/your.apk
adb logcat | grep -i "amako"
```

Repeat the same 5 tests from Step 2 on the real device.

## ✅ Expected Console Output (Success)

When you login, you should see exactly this:

```
🔐 Login in progress: true
🔐 Login: Making request to: https://amakomomo.com/api/login
🔐 Login Success - Token: 26|hGox...
🔐 SessionProvider: Setting new token
🔐 401 counter reset
🔐 Login: Token stored, waiting for propagation...
🔐 Login: Complete, navigating to home
🔐 Login in progress: false
✅ Cart loaded from server successfully
📱 Notifications: 14 items
🛡️ RouteGuard: No redirect needed
```

---

## 🚨 Red Flags (Call for Help)

If you see ANY of these, **stop and debug**:

```
❌ API Error - GET /notifications (before login)
❌ Multiple 401 errors detected - logging out
❌ Navigation loop detected
❌ FATAL EXCEPTION
❌ 5+ consecutive 401 errors
```

These should **NOT appear** with the fixes.

---

## 🎓 How the Fix Works

### 1. Pre-Login Protection
```typescript
// Notifications only fetch when authenticated
enabled: isAuthenticated
```

### 2. Login Grace Period
```typescript
// Don't count 401s during login
if (isLoggingIn) { 
  ignore_error();
}
```

### 3. Token Propagation
```typescript
// Wait 500ms for token to be ready
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));
```

### 4. Higher Tolerance
```typescript
// Allow burst of requests
if (recent401Count >= 5) { // was 3
  logout();
}
```
