---

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### **Fix 1: Instant Review List Refresh** 🔄

#### **Frontend - Cache Invalidation**
**File**: `amako-shop/src/components/OrderDeliveredHandler.tsx`

**Added**:
```typescript
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = useQueryClient();

// After successful review submission:
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['reviews'] });
console.log('🔄 Reviews cache invalidated - list will refresh');
```

**What this does**:
- ✅ Immediately invalidates React Query cache for reviews
- ✅ Triggers automatic refetch of reviews list
- ✅ New/updated review appears instantly in reviews section
- ✅ No need to manually refresh the page

---

### **Fix 2: Proper User Name Display** 👤

#### **Frontend - Explicit User ID Passing**
**File**: `amako-shop/src/components/OrderDeliveredHandler.tsx`

**Added**:
```typescript
import { useSession } from '../hooks/useSession';

const { user } = useSession();

// Pass user ID explicitly in review submission:
const response = await client.post('/reviews', {
  rating: review.rating,
  comment: review.comment,
  orderItem: review.orderItem,
  order_id: deliveredNotification.deliveredOrderId,
  order_number: deliveredNotification.deliveredOrderNumber,
  userId: user?.id, // ✅ Explicitly pass user ID
});
```

**Logging added**:
```typescript
console.log('⭐ Submitting review:', {
  userId: user?.id,
  userName: user?.name,
  // ... other data
});
```

---

#### **Backend - Better User Resolution**
**File**: `routes/api.php`

**Before**:
```php
$user = auth('sanctum')->user();
$userId = $validated['userId'] ?? $user?->id;

$reviewData = [
    'customer_name' => $user?->name ?? 'Anonymous', // ❌ Could be null
    // ...
];
```

**After**:
```php
$user = auth('sanctum')->user();

// Use provided userId first, fall back to authenticated user
$userId = $validated['userId'] ?? $user?->id;
$userName = $user?->name ?? 'Anonymous'; // ✅ Store in variable first
$userEmail = $user?->email;

\Log::info('Review submission attempt', [
    'auth_user_id' => $user?->id,
    'auth_user_name' => $user?->name,
    'provided_user_id' => $validated['userId'] ?? null,
    'final_user_id' => $userId,
    'final_user_name' => $userName, // ✅ See what name is being used
    'has_auth' => !!$user,
    'has_sanctum_token' => !!request()->bearerToken(),
]);

$reviewData = [
    'customer_name' => $userName, // ✅ Use the resolved variable
    'customer_email' => $userEmail,
    // ...
];
```

## 🔍 Root Causes

### **Why Reviews Didn't Update Instantly**:
1. ❌ React Query cache wasn't invalidated after submission
2. ❌ Reviews section kept showing old cached data
3. ❌ User had to manually refresh or wait for cache expiry

### **Why User Showed as "Anonymous"**:
1. ❌ `auth('sanctum')->user()` might be null if token not properly passed
2. ❌ No explicit `userId` passed from frontend
3. ❌ Backend fell back to 'Anonymous' when user was null

---

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **Review Submission Flow**:

```
1. User fills review form
   ↓
2. Frontend sends request with:
   - rating: 5
   - comment: "Great!"
   - userId: 1 ✅ (from session)
   - order_id: 6
   ↓
3. Backend receives request:
   - Checks auth('sanctum')->user() → User object or null
   - Uses provided userId OR fallback to auth user
   - Resolves userName = User.name OR 'Anonymous'
   ↓
4. Backend saves review:
   - user_id: 1
   - customer_name: "John Doe" ✅ (not "Anonymous")
   ↓
5. Backend returns success:
   - { success: true, action: "created" }
   ↓
6. Frontend invalidates cache:
   - queryClient.invalidateQueries(['reviews'])
   ↓
7. React Query automatically refetches:
   - GET /api/reviews
   ↓
8. Reviews list updates instantly:
   - Shows new review immediately ✅
   - Shows correct user name ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Instant Update**:

1. **Login** to the app
2. **Submit review** from Order Delivered modal
3. **See success message**: "Thank You! ⭐"
4. **Go to Reviews section**
5. **Expected**: Your review appears immediately (no refresh needed)

### **Test Correct User Name**:

1. **Login** as "John Doe"
2. **Submit review**
3. **Check logs** (see console):
   ```
   ⭐ Submitting review: {
     userId: 1,
     userName: "John Doe"
   }
   ```
4. **Backend logs**:
   ```
   [INFO] Review submission attempt {
     "auth_user_name": "John Doe",
     "final_user_name": "John Doe"
   }
   ```
5. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name FROM reviews ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
   **Expected**: "John Doe" (not "Anonymous")

## 🐛 Debugging

### **If still showing "Anonymous"**:

**Check frontend logs**:
```
⭐ Submitting review: {
  userId: undefined,  ← ❌ Problem: No user ID
  userName: undefined
}
```

**Fix**: Make sure user is logged in and session hook works:
```typescript
const { user } = useSession();
console.log('Current user:', user); // Should show user object
```

---

**Check backend logs**:
```
[INFO] Review submission attempt {
  "auth_user_id": null,        ← ❌ Problem: Not authenticated
  "auth_user_name": null,
  "provided_user_id": null,
  "has_sanctum_token": false   ← ❌ No token sent
}
```

**Fix**: Make sure API client has auth token:
```typescript
// In src/api/client.ts
console.log('Auth token:', apiClient.defaults.headers.common['Authorization']);
// Should show: "Bearer <token>"
```

---

### **If reviews still don't update instantly**:

**Check if cache invalidation runs**:
```
✅ Review submission response: { success: true }
🔄 Reviews cache invalidated - list will refresh  ← Should see this log
```

**If not seeing the log**:
- Make sure `queryClient.invalidateQueries` is called
- Check if reviews query is using key `['reviews']`

---

**What was wrong**:
